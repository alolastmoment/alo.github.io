The colors for this version [came from this tweet.](https://twitter.com/davegeek1/status/1302151821926871047?s=21)\n\nIt was tested with the following Languages:\n\n-\tEnglish\n\n-\tArabic\n\n-\tDanish\n\n-\tSpanish\n\n-\tTagalog\n\n-\tFrench\n\nThe list of supported devices:\n\n-\t3x notched devices: 11 Pro, XS, X\n\n-\t3x notched Max devices: 11 Pro Max, XS Max\n\n-\t2x notched devices: 11, XR\n\nIf you want to try it on other devices, you will need to rename it according to your device name. The list can be found here: [Laetus Documentation](https://github.com/SparkDev97/LaetusDocumentation#image-themes)\n\nI am not responsible if it doesn't look good because of the different screen size.\n\nHow to Apply the Theme\n----------------------\n\nYou will need Laetus tweak from SparkDev repo, or from his Discord. Then:\n\n1- Go into Laetus settings\n\n2- Tap \"Theme\"\n\n3- Tap \"Select Theme...\"\n\n4- Enable my theme\n\nSafari (and other apps) Mis-aligned Keyboard\n--------------------------------------------\n\nIf you notice that the URL keyboard in safari, or the keyboard when tapping \"To:\" field in Messages or Mail is misaligned, you will need *Keyboard Controller* tweak.\n\nIt is found in BigBoss repo. It allows you to set a specific keyboard layout instead of other layouts.\n\nBasically, please have [the settings similar to the ones I have here in the Imgur album.](https://imgur.com/a/YPW76Wi)\n\nNote\n----\n\nPlease note that the theme is the keyboard layout only. It does *not* include the font or any other modification seen in the preview screenshots.\n","useSpacing":"true","class":"DepictionMarkdownView"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionHeaderView","title":"Information"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Developer","text":"Alo"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Version","text":"1.0"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Compatibility","text":"iOS 13.0 to 14.3"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Section","text":"Themes (Laetus)"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionTableButtonView","title":"Contact Support","action":"depiction-https://alo.works/depiction/native/help/works.alo.laetus.1.purple.json","openExternal":"true","tintColor":"#677E94"},{"class":"DepictionLabelView","text":"Silica 1.2.2 \u2013 Updated 2024-01-24","textColor":"#999999","fontSize":"10.0","alignment":1}],"class":"DepictionStackView"},{"tabname":"Changelog","views":[{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 1.0\n\n\t\n\u2022 Initial Release"},{"class":"DepictionLabelView","text":"Silica 1.2.2 \u2013 Updated 2024-01-24","textColor":"#999999","fontSize":"10.0","alignment":1}],"class":"DepictionStackView"}],"class":"DepictionTabView"}
