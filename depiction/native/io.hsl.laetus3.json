The list can be found here: [Laetus Documentation](https://github.com/SparkDev97/LaetusDocumentation)  \n\nHowever, I am not responsible for any alignment issues if you are using this theme on an unsupported device.  \n\n## How to Apply the Theme  \n\nLaetus is required. This tweak can be found on SparkDev's Repo, or in his discord within the laetus3 channel.  \n\nSteps:  \n\n1. Go into Laetus settings\n2. Enable \"Theme\" mode\n3. Tap \"Select Theme...\"\n4. Enable my theme  \n\n[These are my laetus settings](https://imgur.com/a/RgUuiQc)  \n\n## Safari (and other apps) Mis-aligned Keyboard  \n  \nI tried my best to mitigate this issue, but it's still possible that this theme could appear as mis-aligned when other keyboard types are displayed. A workaround is using the Keyboard Controller tweak from BigBoss, which allows to specify which keyboard layout is invoked for certain situations. [Here are my settings to use as a reference](https://imgur.com/a/Txpgh2V)  \n  \n\n## Note  \n\nPlease note that the theme is solely for the keyboard layout. It does *not* include the font or any other modification seen in the preview screenshots.\n","useSpacing":"true","class":"DepictionMarkdownView"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionHeaderView","title":"Information"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Developer","text":"happysolucki"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Version","text":"1.0.3"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Compatibility","text":"iOS 13.0 to 14.3"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Section","text":"Themes (Laetus)"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionTableButtonView","title":"Contact Support","action":"depiction-https://alo.works/depiction/native/help/io.hsl.laetus3.json","openExternal":"true","tintColor":"#677E94"},{"class":"DepictionLabelView","text":"Silica 1.2.2 \u2013 Updated 2021-04-16","textColor":"#999999","fontSize":"10.0","alignment":1}],"class":"DepictionStackView"},{"tabname":"Changelog","views":[{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 1.0.3\n\n\t\n\u2022 Proper support for XR/11 and X/11 Pro in all supported languages"},{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 1.0.2\n\n\t\n\u2022 Some subtle changes"},{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 1.0.1\n\n\t\n\u2022 Some subtle changes"},{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 1.0.0\n\n\t\n\u2022 Initial version"},{"class":"DepictionLabelView","text":"Silica 1.2.2 \u2013 Updated 2021-04-16","textColor":"#999999","fontSize":"10.0","alignment":1}],"class":"DepictionStackView"}],"class":"DepictionTabView"}
