Some tweaks don't have settings icons I can theme). It\u2019s a mix of Apple stock CC toggles and CCModules.  \n\n\n**Animated toggles such as Lock Orientation, DND, Screen Recorder and LPM cannot be themed.**  \n\n\nPlease do not ask me about them.  \n\n\nThis was tested on iPhone 11 Pro (13.5) and iPhone XS (12.1.1) and iPhone X (11.3.1).  \n\n\n## How to Apply the Theme\n## iOS 13\n\n You should use **Snowboard + Snowboard UI Extention** from SparkDev's Repo, or **iThemer**.  \n\n\n - **Prysm**  \n\n\n If the theme doesn't apply after you enable it in your theme engine (and have it above any other CC theme you have), you'll need to move the Icons inside  */Library/Themes/Lineal CC.theme/Bundles/Prysm/Icons*   **to**   */Library/Application Support/Prysm/Icons*  \n\n**Remember to back up the original icons first!**  \n\n - **Stock CC**  \n\n\nThe WiFi and Bluetooth icons are themed using **BetterCCIcons13**. I've included both files inside the theme folder   */Library/Themes/Lineal CC.theme/Bundles/BetterCCIconsPro* , so you guys need to move them (just the images, not the entire folder) to   */Library/PreferenceBundles/BetterCCIcons13.bundle* and then enable Glyph mode in the settings.  \n\n\n - **Animated Toggles**  \n\n\nSuch as DND, Lock Orientation and so on are themed, you need the toggles from FlipConvert from JulioVerne's repo, and FlipSwitch from rpetri repo.  \n\n\n## iOS 11-12\n\nYou should use **Snowboard + Snowboard UI Extentio**n from SparkDev's Repo, or **iThemer**, or  **Anemone 2.7** or **2.8**.  \n\n  - **Prysm**  \n\n\n If the theme doesn't apply after you enable it in your theme engine (and have it above any other CC theme you have), you'll need to move the Icons inside  */Library/Themes/Lineal CC.theme/Folders/Prysm/Icons*   **to**   */Library/Application Support/Prysm/Icons*  \n\n**Remember to back up the original icons first!**  \n\n - **Stock CC**  \n\n\nThe WiFi and Bluetooth icons are themed using **BetterCCIconsPro**.

I've spent a lot of effort and invested time into this for everyone. I hope it's to your liking!\n","useSpacing":"true","class":"DepictionMarkdownView"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionHeaderView","title":"Information"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Developer","text":"Alo"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Version","text":"1.4"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Compatibility","text":"iOS 11.0 to 14.3"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Section","text":"Themes (Control Center)"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionTableButtonView","title":"Contact Support","action":"depiction-https://alo.works/depiction/native/help/io.github.worksbybbs.linealcc.json","openExternal":"true","tintColor":"#677E94"},{"class":"DepictionLabelView","text":"Silica 1.2.2 \u2013 Updated 2021-01-06","textColor":"#999999","fontSize":"10.0","alignment":1}],"class":"DepictionStackView"},{"tabname":"Changelog","views":[{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 1.4\n\n\t\n\u2022 Should theme Prysm automatically when applied in (Snowboard) theme engine."},{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 1.3\n\n\t\n\u2022 Added Prysm Support"},{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 1.2\n\n\t\n\u2022 Moved Top Bar Icons to Lineal Statusbar Theme"},{"class":"DepictionLabelView","text":"Silica 1.2.2 \u2013 Updated 2021-01-06","textColor":"#999999","fontSize":"10.0","alignment":1}],"class":"DepictionStackView"}],"class":"DepictionTabView"}
