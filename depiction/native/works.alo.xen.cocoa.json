Made by [HSL](https://twitter.com/happysolucki). Special thanks to [Kenny](https://twitter.com/_kennyroo?s=21), [HNDRK](https://twitter.com/paolopizzaiola?s=21), & [Paras](https://twitter.com/paraskcd?s=21) for helping me put this together.\n\nPlease look [at this demo](https://twitter.com/happysolucki/status/1358527395251249154) to understand how the widget functions.\n\n#### Xen HTML ver. 2.0~beta8 or higher is required. Get it from https://xenpublic.incendo.ws/\n\n### **Setup**\n\nIf you want to use this widget as a OPW (One-Page Widget), here are some steps you should take:\n\n- **Completely hide the dock.** There are multiple tweaks that can do this but the ones i\u2019ve used before are Shydock and Lynx.\n- **Hide your apps.** Lynx, Genesis 2, & HideYourApps are tweaks that can achieve this.  **Note: hiding your apps will also get rid of your folders too, so bare that in mind.**\n- **Set the widget in Foreground Mode** in Xen HTML.\n\n### **Options**\n\nYou can configure the following options:\n\n- Username\n- Quote inside the Time Box\n- Greeting Text / Text Color\n- Preferred appearance (Default or Blur)\n- Badge color, width, & height\n- Hiding certain elements\n- Reset (incase something doesn\u2019t work properly or to reset widget app storage)\n- Boxy Mode\n\n\n#### Note\nThis package only contains the widget. It doesn't contain any fonts, themes, or any other modifications shown in the screenshots.\n","useSpacing":"true","class":"DepictionMarkdownView"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionHeaderView","title":"Information"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Developer","text":"HSL"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Version","text":"2.0"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Compatibility","text":"iOS 9.0 to 14.3"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Section","text":"Widgets"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionTableButtonView","title":"Contact Support","action":"depiction-https://alo.works/depiction/native/help/works.alo.xen.cocoa.json","openExternal":"true","tintColor":"#677E94"},{"class":"DepictionLabelView","text":"Silica 1.2.2 \u2013 Updated 2021-03-08","textColor":"#999999","fontSize":"10.0","alignment":1}],"class":"DepictionStackView"},{"tabname":"Changelog","views":[{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 2.0\n\n\t\n\u2022 Revamped widget settings for Xen HTML ver. 2.0~beta8 and higher \t\n\u2022 Added Boxy Mode \t\n\u2022 Added option to only show home container \t\n\u2022 Added option to only show music container"},{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 1.0\n\n\t\n\u2022 Initial Release"},{"class":"DepictionLabelView","text":"Silica 1.2.2 \u2013 Updated 2021-03-08","textColor":"#999999","fontSize":"10.0","alignment":1}],"class":"DepictionStackView"}],"class":"DepictionTabView"}
