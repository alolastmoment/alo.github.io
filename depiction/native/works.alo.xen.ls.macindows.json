I personally use Orion. Also, set it as a ** Foreground Widget **\n\n### Features\n\nThis widget adapts to your system appearance. There are also options to change the username in the statusbar and enable your system\u2019s font. The font used when this option\u2019s enabled depends on the jailbreak you\u2019re using. If you\u2019re using unc0ver or checkra1n, your snowboard font will be used if possible. If you\u2019re using a libhooker-based jailbreak, the widget will pull your font from internal font folders located at /System/Library/Fonts.\n\n### Special Thanks\n\nIf you have any interest in windows theming, check out [niivu](https://www.deviantart.com/niivu). He has shared a ton of neat customizations that are free for personal use.\n\n\n#### Note\nThis package only contains the widget. It doesn't contain any fonts, themes, or any other modifications shown in the screenshots.\n","useSpacing":"true","class":"DepictionMarkdownView"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionHeaderView","title":"Information"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Developer","text":"HSL"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Version","text":"1.0"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Compatibility","text":"iOS 9.0 to 14.3"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Section","text":"Widgets"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionTableButtonView","title":"Contact Support","action":"depiction-https://alo.works/depiction/native/help/works.alo.xen.ls.macindows.json","openExternal":"true","tintColor":"#677E94"},{"class":"DepictionLabelView","text":"Silica 1.2.2 \u2013 Updated 2024-01-24","textColor":"#999999","fontSize":"10.0","alignment":1}],"class":"DepictionStackView"},{"tabname":"Changelog","views":[{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 1.0\n\n\t\n\u2022 Initial Release"},{"class":"DepictionLabelView","text":"Silica 1.2.2 \u2013 Updated 2024-01-24","textColor":"#999999","fontSize":"10.0","alignment":1}],"class":"DepictionStackView"}],"class":"DepictionTabView"}
