This widget is an iOS rendition of [mocacocoa’s kwlp](https://twitter.com/mocacocoa_theme/status/1335903782895374337) with some added features. Made by [HSL](https://twitter.com/happysolucki). Special thanks to [Kenny](https://twitter.com/_kennyroo?s=21), [HNDRK](https://twitter.com/paolopizzaiola?s=21), & [Paras](https://twitter.com/paraskcd?s=21) for helping me put this together.

Please look [at this demo](https://twitter.com/happysolucki/status/1358527395251249154) to understand how the widget functions.

#### Xen HTML ver. 2.0~beta8 or higher is required. Get it from https://xenpublic.incendo.ws/

### **Setup**

If you want to use this widget as a OPW (One-Page Widget), here are some steps you should take:

- **Completely hide the dock.** There are multiple tweaks that can do this but the ones i’ve used before are Shydock and Lynx.
- **Hide your apps.** Lynx, Genesis 2, & HideYourApps are tweaks that can achieve this.  **Note: hiding your apps will also get rid of your folders too, so bare that in mind.**
- **Set the widget in Foreground Mode** in Xen HTML.

### **Options**

You can configure the following options:

- Username
- Quote inside the Time Box
- Greeting Text / Text Color
- Preferred appearance (Default or Blur)
- Badge color, width, & height
- Hiding certain elements
- Reset (incase something doesn’t work properly or to reset widget app storage)
- Boxy Mode


#### Note
This package only contains the widget. It doesn't contain any fonts, themes, or any other modifications shown in the screenshots.
