This widget is an iOS rendition of [mocacocoa’s kwlp](https://twitter.com/mocacocoa_theme/status/1335903782895374337) with some added features. Special thanks to [Kenny](https://twitter.com/_kennyroo?s=21), [HNDRK](https://twitter.com/paolopizzaiola?s=21), & [Paras](https://twitter.com/paraskcd?s=21) for helping me put this together.

Please look [at this demo](https://twitter.com/happysolucki/status/1358527395251249154?s=21) to understand how the widget functions.

#### Xen HTML ver. 2.0~beta8 or higher is required. Get it from https://xenpublic.incendo.ws/

### **Setup**

To have an optimal experience using the widget, here are some steps you should take:

- **Completely hide the dock.** There are multiple tweaks that can do this but the ones i’ve used before are Shydock and Lynx.
- **Move** **your apps that are on page 1 of your homescreen to a different page.**
- **Set the widget in Foreground Mode on page 1**.

- Theme (Original or Frosty)
- Custom text

- Blur intensity
- Badge color, width, & height
- Hide certain elements
