Alo (Laetus #1)
---------------

A Reva UI inspired Laetus theme.

It was tested with the following Languages:* English* Arabic* Danish* Spanish* Tagalog* French

It is only for Notched 3x Devices (e.g. X, 11 Pro)
--------------------------------------------------

If you want to try it on other devices, you will need to rename it according to your device name. The list can be found here: [Laetus Documentation](https://github.com/SparkDev97/LaetusDocumentation#image-themes)

I am not responsible if it doesn't look good because of the different screen size.

How to Apply the Theme
----------------------

You will need Laetus tweak from SparkDev repo, or from his Discord. Then:

1- Go into Laetus settings

2- Tap "Theme"

3- Tap "Select Theme..."

4- Enable my theme

Note
----

Please note that the theme is thekeyboard layout only. It does *not* include the font or any other modification seen in the preview screenshots.
