A playful lockscreen widget inspired by [niivu’s Macindows theme](https://www.deviantart.com/niivu/art/Macindows-870073866).

Xen HTML ver. 2.0-release is required.

### [Demo](https://twitter.com/happysolucki/status/1401568846134362112?s=21)

### Setup

There’s not much for me to tell you other than you should probably hide the lockscreen music player using your preferred tweak. I personally use Orion. Also, set it as a ** Foreground Widget **

### Features

This widget adapts to your system appearance. There are also options to change the username in the statusbar and enable your system’s font. The font used when this option’s enabled depends on the jailbreak you’re using. If you’re using unc0ver or checkra1n, your snowboard font will be used if possible. If you’re using a libhooker-based jailbreak, the widget will pull your font from internal font folders located at /System/Library/Fonts.

### Special Thanks
