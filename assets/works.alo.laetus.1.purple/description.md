Alo (Laetus #1) - The Purple Variant
------------------------------------

A Reva UI inspired Laetus theme. The colors for this version [came from this tweet.](https://twitter.com/davegeek1/status/1302151821926871047?s=21)

It was tested with the following Languages:

-	English

-	Arabic

-	Danish

-	Spanish

-	Tagalog

-	French

The list of supported devices:

-	3x notched devices: 11 Pro, XS, X

-	3x notched Max devices: 11 Pro Max, XS Max

-	2x notched devices: 11, XR

If you want to try it on other devices, you will need to rename it according to your device name. The list can be found here: [Laetus Documentation](https://github.com/SparkDev97/LaetusDocumentation#image-themes)

I am not responsible if it doesn't look good because of the different screen size.

How to Apply the Theme
----------------------

You will need Laetus tweak from SparkDev repo, or from his Discord. Then:

1- Go into Laetus settings

2- Tap "Theme"

3- Tap "Select Theme..."

4- Enable my theme

Safari (and other apps) Mis-aligned Keyboard
--------------------------------------------

If you notice that the URL keyboard in safari, or the keyboard when tapping "To:" field in Messages or Mail is misaligned, you will need <span style="color:#ff7369;">*Keyboard Controller*</span> tweak.

It is found in BigBoss repo. It allows you to set a specific keyboard layout instead of other layouts.

Basically, please have [the settings similar to the ones I have here in the Imgur album.](https://imgur.com/a/YPW76Wi)

Note
----

Please note that the theme is the keyboard layout only. It does *not* include the font or any other modification seen in the preview screenshots.
