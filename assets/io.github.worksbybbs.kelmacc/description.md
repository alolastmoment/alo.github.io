## Kelma CC for iOS 11 - 13.


The only CC toggles themed are the ones that have a settings icon (mostly. Some tweaks don't have settings icons I can theme). Itâ€™s a mix of Apple stock CC toggles and CCModules.

**Animated toggles such as Lock Orientation, DND, Screen Recorder and LPM cannot be themed.**

Please do not ask me about them.

This was tested on iPhone 11 Pro (13.5) and iPhone XS (12.1.1) and iPhone X (11.3.1).

## How to Apply the Theme
## iOS 13

 You should use **Snowboard + Snowboard UI Extention** from SparkDev's Repo, or **iThemer**.

 - **Prysm**
 If the theme doesn't apply after you enable it in your theme engine, you'll need to move the Icons inside  */Library/Themes/Kelma CC.theme/Bundles/Prysm/Icons*   **to**   */Library/Application Support/Prysm/Icons*

**Remember to back up the original icons first!**

 - **Stock CC**
The WiFi and Bluetooth icons are themed using **BetterCCIcons13**. I've included both files inside the theme folder   */Library/Themes/Kelma CC.theme/Bundles/BetterCCIconsPro* , so you guys need to move them (just the images, not the entire folder) to   */Library/PreferenceBundles/BetterCCIcons13.bundle* and then enable Glyph mode in the settings.


 - **Animated Toggles**
Such as DND, Lock Orientation and so on are themed, you need the toggles from FlipConvert from JulioVerne's repo, and FlipSwitch from rpetri repo.


## iOS 11-12

You should use **Snowboard + Snowboard UI Extentio**n from SparkDev's Repo, or **iThemer**, or  **Anemone 2.7** or **2.8**.

 If the theme doesn't apply after you enable it in your theme engine, you'll need to move the Icons inside  */Library/Themes/Kelma CC.theme/Folders/Prysm/Icons*   **to**   */Library/Application Support/Prysm/Icons*

As a last note, although this is free, donations are *very* welcome. I've spent a lot of effort and invested time into this for everyone. I hope it's to your liking!
