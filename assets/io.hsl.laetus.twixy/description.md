  ### Non-Notch Devices
  
  Please send a DM [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/happysolucki) to try and have this theme work for non-notch devices.

## Safari (and other apps) Mis-aligned Keyboard  
  
I tried my best to mitigate this issue, but it's still possible that this theme could appear as mis-aligned when other keyboard types are displayed. A workaround is using the Keyboard Controller tweak from BigBoss, which allows to specify which keyboard layout is invoked for certain situations. [Here are my settings to use as a reference](https://imgur.com/a/Txpgh2V)  
  
  


## Note  

Please note that the theme is solely for the keyboard layout. It does *not* include the font or any other modification seen in the preview screenshots.
