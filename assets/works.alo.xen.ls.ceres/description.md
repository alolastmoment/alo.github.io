An elegant and beautiful lockscreen widget that shows you the time and weather quickly at a glance. Features a colored battery bill designed to know the battery state easily.

Original Android design is by [jacksonhayes701](https://twitter.com/jacksonhayes701). Major thanks to them for letting me replicate it for XenHTML.

### Requires the latest XenHTML from [https://xenpublic.incendo.ws](https://xenpublic.incendo.ws), or from Packix.

## Options
- Battery Pill Color (Discharging/Default, Discharging below 20%, LPM, and Charging States)
- Time Text Color
- Date Text Color
- Weather Condition Text Color
- White or Black Bolt Image




**Disclaimer**: This was thoroughly tested on 11 Pro, and 12 Pro. I hope there are no alignment issues or such on other devices.

Note

Please note that the widget do not include any themes, wallpapers, or any other modifications that may appear in the preview screenshots.
