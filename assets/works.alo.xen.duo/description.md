Duo XenHTML Widgets
-----------------------------------

This package contains 3 Universal widgets, which can be used on LS or HS with XenHTML.

The **LS | Duo Card** original design was made by [Json_zne](https://twitter.com/Json_zne). I modified it a bit.

It should be noted that this was made for personal use, so not all weather icons may be included -- we basically have 2 seasons here ðŸ˜‚.

There are **NO** options to configure. Any modifications should be done in either the html or style.css files.


Note
----

Please note that the widget is the just the card and the dual tone backgrounds only. It does *not* include the icons (Bubblegum theme) or font (it takes your device font) or any other modification seen in the preview screenshots.
