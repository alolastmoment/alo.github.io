## Lineal CC for iOS 11 - 13.

This is designed to work with Lineal UI and Lineal Music Controls to get the full look (if you're on iOS 11-12)!<br />

The only CC toggles themed are the ones that have a settings icon (mostly. Some tweaks don't have settings icons I can theme). Itâ€™s a mix of Apple stock CC toggles and CCModules.<br />

**Animated toggles such as Lock Orientation, DND, Screen Recorder and LPM cannot be themed.**<br />

Please do not ask me about them.<br />

This was tested on iPhone 11 Pro (13.5) and iPhone XS (12.1.1) and iPhone X (11.3.1).<br />

## How to Apply the Theme
## iOS 13

 You should use **Snowboard + Snowboard UI Extention** from SparkDev's Repo, or **iThemer**.<br />

 - **Prysm**<br />
 If the theme doesn't apply after you enable it in your theme engine, you'll need to move the Icons inside  */Library/Themes/Lineal CC.theme/Bundles/Prysm/Icons*   **to**   */Library/Application Support/Prysm/Icons*<br />

**Remember to back up the original icons first!**<br />

 - **Stock CC**<br />
The WiFi and Bluetooth icons are themed using **BetterCCIcons13**. I've included both files inside the theme folder   */Library/Themes/Lineal CC.theme/Bundles/BetterCCIconsPro* , so you guys need to move them (just the images, not the entire folder) to   */Library/PreferenceBundles/BetterCCIcons13.bundle* and then enable Glyph mode in the settings.<br />


 - **Animated Toggles**<br />
Such as DND, Lock Orientation and so on are themed, you need the toggles from FlipConvert from JulioVerne's repo, and FlipSwitch from rpetri repo.<br />


## iOS 11-12

You should use **Snowboard + Snowboard UI Extentio**n from SparkDev's Repo, or **iThemer**, or  **Anemone 2.7** or **2.8**.<br />

  - **Prysm**<br />

As a last note, although this is free, donations are *very* welcome. I've spent a lot of effort and invested time into this for everyone. I hope it's to your liking!
