Iridescent
-----------------------------------

This package contains the entire collection of my kaleidscope presets. Instead of having them scattered across my setups, I thought it best to be packaged in a single source!

This package will be frequently updated with more presets as I make them.

This requires **Kaleidoscope** tweak from SparkDev repo.

Disclaimer
----
I made these for my setups. Most of them look good in dark mode mainly as I used to focus on that. Hence, I cannot guarantee all and everything will look good. If something's not to your liking, you may change it. 

#### If you change anything, make sure to save a backup of it before any updates as it will be overwritten.

Note
----

Please note that the package doesn't include any modifications seen in the screenshots such as font, or themes. It only contains Kaleidoscope presets.
