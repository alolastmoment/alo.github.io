Double Bubble Settings (by Roo)
------------------------------------------

A modern and fresh rework of bubblegum settings. Features pastel colors that work well with any setup; light or dark!

## This theme contains:
- Settings Icons
- Switchknob theme

How to Apply the Theme
----------------------

The recommended theme engine is **Snowboard + Snowboard Settings Extension**. You can also use the other theme engines such as iThemer, but there's no guarantee that all icons will be themed.

Note
----

Please note that the theme is the colorful icons only. It does *not* include the font or any other modification seen in the preview screenshots.
