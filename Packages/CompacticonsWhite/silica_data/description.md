## Compacticons White for iOS
The white version of Compacticons glyph theme for iOS. The original creator and all credit goes to **[tatosXL](https://www.deviantart.com/tatosxl).**

I only ported the icons to be compatible with iOS theming, and modified/constructed a few icons.

This theme contains 450+ icons, and covers all stock apple icons, 3rd party applications, and a few games as well.


## How to Apply the Theme
For the HS icons, you may use any theme engine of your choice. For the UI icons:
  1- If using iThemer, they should work as is
  2- If using Snowboard, you will need Snowboard UI Extension for SparkDev Repo.

## Note
Please note that the theme is the HS and keyboard icons only. It does *not* include the font or any other modification seen in the preview screenshots.
