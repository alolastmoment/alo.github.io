## Flat Music Controls
They work in the music app, LS, and CC.


## How to Apply the Theme
The recommended theme engine is **Snowboard + Snowboard UI Extension**. You can also use the other theme engines such as iThemer.

## Help! Huge Blurry Music Controls Using Snowboard?!
Please navigate to Settings > Snowboard > Extensions... Click on UI Extension settings, then toggle OFF 'Resize Music Controls'.

## Note
The theme is the music controls only (Play/Pause/Rewind/Forward). It doesn't include any modifications you might see in the screenshots.
