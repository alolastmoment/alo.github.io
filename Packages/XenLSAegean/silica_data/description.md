LS | Aegean Clock Widget
-----------------------------------

This package contains the LS clock featured in my setup Aegean. Since it's in the Universal section in XenHTML, it can actually be used in either LS or HS depending on your preference.

The **LS | Aegean Clock** original design was made by [Json_zne](https://twitter.com/Json_zne). I created it for XenHTML.

It should be noted that this was made for personal use, so it might not be 100% polished but hey, this is what I came up with üòÅ

### Configurable Colors

* Rings
* Text (Clock numbers and date all together)
* Hour Hand
* Minute Hand
* Center Circle inside the clock
* Left Circle (of the date)
* Right Circle (of the date)


Note
----

Please note that the widget is the just the clock only. It does *not* include the icons or any other modification seen in the preview screenshots.
